# Robusta
Robusta is a type of coffee, just like Java. Ironically, it is completely Java oriented and functions as such.
Similar to some newer technologies today, Robusta helps in running and producing code for Java programs (more specifically loops like the pyramid loops, complex series and more). This program will be ever changing and will hence be continously updated over time.
## Usage
As of 19/2/2022, there is no 'release' but the commands available are as follows: <br/>
`::gen` - Opens the code generator system which functions based on options chosen by the user. <br/>
`::math` - Opens the mathematics system of the bot. <br/>
`::exit` - Closes the bot. <br/>
The key to turn the bot on is `$botOnl`.
## Credits
This bot has been developed completely by @SevenCuts04 with the occasional dose of StackOverflow ;)
